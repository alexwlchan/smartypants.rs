# smartypants.rs

This is an in-progress, unreleased Rust port of John Gruber's [SmartyPants tool][df].
Most of the logic is written, but I'm still sorting out:

*   What the public API will look like
*   Writing a full set of tests
*   Documentation
*   Tidying up some of the codebase



## Credits

The idea from this library comes from [SmartPants][df], a tool originally released by John Gruber in 2002.

Additionally, I looked at Leo Hemsted's [Python port][py] to help me understand the logic.

This project is neither affiliated with nor endorsed by John Gruber.
